# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction

This project involved the application of machine learning techniques to predict credit card defaults. We utilized a robust dataset that included demographic, financial, and behavioral attributes of credit card holders. The data was processed and cleaned to ensure its quality, and exploratory analysis was performed to gain insights into underlying trends and patterns.

In the predictive modeling phase, we employed relevant features from the dataset to train multiple machine learning models. The models used for prediction included K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees. These algorithms were selected for their suitability in tackling classification problems like credit card default prediction.

Following model training, we carried out optimization and fine-tuning to enhance the models' performance. The chosen model demonstrated promising predictive ability, effectively identifying potential credit card defaults based on the selected features.

Overall, this project showcases the power of machine learning in predicting credit card default, providing valuable insights for risk management and decision-making in the financial industry.
